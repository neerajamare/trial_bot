My First ROS2 Robotics Project
Welcome to my first-ever Git repository! This project is part of my journey to learn and enhance my skills in ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) and Robotics.

Project Overview
In this repository, I’ll be building a project from scratch, following along with a series of tutorials by Articulated Robotics on YouTube. My goal is to learn key concepts in ROS2 and robotics while applying them to this project. I’ll be adding my own unique features and customizations as I progress.

Approach
Initially, the project will be developed entirely within simulations, allowing me to focus on understanding the core concepts before transitioning to hardware-based models later on. This provides a great opportunity to experiment, learn, and iterate without the constraints of physical robots.

What’s Included
ROS2 setup and configuration

Simulation-based models and environment

Custom features and improvements beyond the tutorial content

Potential future expansions to hardware (once I'm ready!)

Join the Adventure!
This is a fun and exciting adventure of learning while doing! If you’re interested in ROS2, robotics, or just enjoy following along with projects like this, tag along and feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or simply watch the progress unfold.

Let’s dive into the world of robotics together!
